# The Game Of Thonk (TGoT)

### About
This is a simple game created by me in order to learn and understand:
- [Unity](https://unity.com/) (2020.3)
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) Development

For anyone interested, I'm learning my way around Unity using [their
learning platform](https://learn.unity.com/).

### Contributing
This project isn't a formal game (yet) but rather a way for me to learn,
so contributions aren't expected. If you do have some sort of suggestion
to improve the project then feel free to tell
me about it.

### Donating
You don't.
