# The Game Of Thonk (TGoT)

### About
This is a simple game created by me in order to learn and understand:
- [Unity](https://unity.com/) (2020.3)
- [C#](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) Development

For anyone interested, I'm learning my way around Unity using [their
learning platform](https://learn.unity.com/).

### Playing
#### Supported Platforms
Currently the game is available for the following platforms:
- Linux (64-bit)
- MacOS (Intel 64-bit and Apple Silicon)
- Windows (64-bit)
- WebGL (Defaults to [http://localhost:57492/](http://localhost:57492/))

Note that you may have to do more for playing on MacOS and Linux (converting to program), however
everything is done and ready for windows via the TGoT Installer.
#### Installation
Download the installer from the [releases page](https://github.com/TechnoShip123/TGoT/releases/latest/)
and run it. Windows might warn you with something along the lines of 
_"This app could harm your device blah blah blah"_. Press _"Run anyway"_ and walk through the installer. 
Once finished, you should see the game in the Start Menu (_All Apps_ section). Just click
to run the game!
#### Uninstallation
To uninstall the game, head to `Control Panel > Programs > Programs and Features` 
(Uninstall or change a program). Right clicking the game and pressing
uninstall should take you there as well. Find the game in the list
of applications, and select it, then press **uninstall**.

### Contributing
This project isn't a formal game (yet) but rather a way for me to learn,
so contributions aren't expected. If you do have some sort of suggestion
to improve the project then feel free to tell
me about it.

### Donating
You don't.
